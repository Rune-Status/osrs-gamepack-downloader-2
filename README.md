# OSRS Gamepack Downloader

Simple OldSchool RuneScape gamepack downloader written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).

What does this program do?

- Downloads and parses the official OldSchool 
    [jav_config.ws](https://oldschool.runescape.com/jav_config.ws) to get the 
    gamepack URL.
- Downloads the gamepack from the parsed  URL (codebase + initial_jar)
- Analyzes the gamepack's bytecode to determine the actual revision.
- Writes the gamepack to the provided (or current) directory.

## Prerequisites

- Java SE 8 or higher, available [here](https://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html).

## Building

Use the included `gradlew` (Linux/OSX) or `gradlew.bat` (Windows) files to let gradle build the file.

The executable will be located at `build/libs/osrs-gamepack-downloader.jar`. 


## Usage

gamepack to the same directory and name it accordingly.
